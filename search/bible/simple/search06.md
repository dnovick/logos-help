# 06: The `term`  Operator

NOTE: This is WIP.

## Concepts
- The `term` search operator.

## Description
By default, when you use search operators like `AND` and `OR`, Logos will highlight each match in a different color in the search results. Sometimes, this is undesirable. instead, one would rather have the search results hits displayed as a single highlighted item. Using `term` makes this possible.

## Search Configuration
